    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = 'Dude'; // MAKES REFERNCE TO ORIGINAL ARRAY -- CHANGED TOO!

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice(); // MAKES COPY INTO NEW ARRAY
    team2[3] = 'Team2'


    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    team3[3] = 'Team3'

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]; // SPREAD
    team4[3] = 'Team4'

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[3] = 'Team5';

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const capt = person;
    capt.number = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const capt2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 44, age: 21 }); // blank object, object to copy, new props
    console.log(capt2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const capt3 = {...person};
    capt3.number = 55;
    console.log(capt3);
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
